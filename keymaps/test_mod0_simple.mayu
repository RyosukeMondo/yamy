# Simple test for mod0 modal modifier
include "109_clean.mayu"

# Define mod0 as B key with !! operator (one-shot modal)
mod mod0 = !!B

# Test mod0 combinations - while holding B:
key m0-*A = *_1   # B+A outputs "1"
key m0-*S = *_2   # B+S outputs "2"
key m0-*D = *_3   # B+D outputs "3"

# NOTE: B key has NO substitution - it should be suppressed when held
# Tap B quickly = outputs B normally
# Hold B = activates mod0
