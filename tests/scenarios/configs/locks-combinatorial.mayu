# Locks Combinatorial Test Configuration
# Tests lock toggle behavior and lock combinations

# Substitute C key to L00 lock
def subst *C = *L00

# Substitute D key to L01 lock
def subst *D = *L01

# Single lock mappings
key L00-A = *B
key L01-A = *H

# Combo lock mapping (both L00 and L01 must be active)
key L00-L01-A = *Left

# Test that physical keys still work normally
# (no mapping for plain A)
