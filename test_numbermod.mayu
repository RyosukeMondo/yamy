# Test file for number modifier syntax
# This demonstrates the new "def numbermod" syntax added in task 4.5

# Map number keys to hardware modifiers
def numbermod *_1 = *LShift
def numbermod *_2 = *RShift
def numbermod *_3 = *LCtrl
def numbermod *_4 = *RCtrl
def numbermod *_5 = *LAlt
def numbermod *_6 = *RAlt
def numbermod *_7 = *LWin
def numbermod *_8 = *RWin

# These can be used in combination with hold/tap detection
# When you HOLD the number key (>200ms), it acts as the modifier
# When you TAP the number key (<200ms), it performs normal substitution
