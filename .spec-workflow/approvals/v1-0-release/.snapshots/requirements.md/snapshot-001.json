The current Linux port is 98.5% complete (129/131 tasks from the linux-complete-port spec), with only integration testing and documentation remaining. This spec addresses the final polish, quality assurance, and release preparation necessary for a stable v1.0 launch.\n\n### Purpose\n\nTransform the feature-complete Linux port into a production-ready release by:\n- Completing pending integration tests and user documentation\n- Fixing identified code quality issues and build errors\n- Formalizing test coverage and CI/CD integration\n- Validating compatibility across Linux distributions and desktop environments\n- Preparing release artifacts and distribution channels\n\n### Value to Users\n\n- **Cross-Platform Developers**: Confidence that YAMY works reliably on Linux with same behavior as Windows\n- **Power Users**: Comprehensive documentation enabling rapid onboarding and troubleshooting\n- **Contributors**: Clean, well-tested codebase ready for community contributions\n- **Package Maintainers**: Stable release with proper versioning and installation procedures\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis release directly supports the **Short-Term (Q1 2025)** goals from product.md:\n\n1. ✅ **Linux Feature Parity** - Core functionality complete (129/131 tasks)\n2. 🔄 **Qt GUI Polish** - Final quality checks and fixes\n3. 🔄 **Documentation** - User guides, troubleshooting, examples\n4. ✅ **Community Building** - Ready for public release and adoption\n\n### Success Metric Targets (from product.md)\n\n| Metric | Target | Current Status | Gap |\n|--------|--------|----------------|-----|\n| **Performance** | <1ms latency (p99) | ✅ Achieved | None |\n| **Quality** | <5 P0 bugs | ⚠️ 3 code issues + build errors | Fix 4 issues |\n| **Test Coverage** | 80% minimum | ❓ Unknown | Add coverage reporting |\n| **Documentation** | Complete user guides | ❌ Missing | Create 3 docs |\n\n## Requirements\n\n### FR-1: Complete Integration Testing\n\n**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive integration tests covering all components working together, so that I can verify the system meets all functional requirements before release.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN integration test suite executes THEN all 18 test cases pass without errors\n2. WHEN build system compiles tests THEN no linker errors occur (ConfigWatcher vtable, IIPCChannel references)\n3. WHEN tests run in CI environment THEN they complete successfully using Xvfb (no display required)\n4. WHEN full lifecycle test runs THEN engine starts, loads config, processes keys, and stops cleanly\n5. WHEN IPC tests execute THEN all 7+ command types (reload, stop, status, etc.) work correctly\n6.
