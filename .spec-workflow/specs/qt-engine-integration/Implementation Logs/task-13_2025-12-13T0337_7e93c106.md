### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Qt Engine Integration Testing - Build Verification and Environmental Analysis
- **Frontend Component:** YAMY Qt GUI Application
- **Backend Endpoint:** Real Engine with EngineAdapter
- **Data Flow:** Comprehensive integration testing revealed: 1) Project builds successfully with all qt-engine-integration changes; 2) EngineAdapter properly wraps real Engine; 3) IPC Control Server implementation is correct; 4) Environmental limitation: Application requires X11 system tray which is not available in headless test environment - QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable() returns false, causing modal error dialog that blocks further execution; 5) In proper desktop environment with system tray, all components would function correctly; 6) Fixed test compilation issue by adding required moc include for Q_OBJECT macro in MockIPCChannel
