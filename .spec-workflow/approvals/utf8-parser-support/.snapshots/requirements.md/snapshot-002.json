This limitation prevents international keyboard users from using their native language in configuration files and blocks proper support for IME-related keys (無変換, 変換, 英数, etc.) that are essential for Japanese keyboard layouts.\n\nThe parser's tokenizer incorrectly assumes UTF-8 characters are at most 2 bytes and misaligns character boundaries, causing key definitions with Japanese primary names (e.g., `def key 無変換 NonConvert = 0x7b`) to fail registration. Users are currently forced to manually edit 169+ key definitions in `109.mayu` to use ASCII-only names, breaking the original Japanese keyboard layout support.\n\nThis feature will fix the UTF-8 handling in the configuration parser to properly support international users and restore full Japanese keyboard layout functionality.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports **Tertiary Target Users: International Keyboard Users** identified in `product.md`:\n- **Pain Point Addressed**: \"Non-US keyboard layouts poorly supported\" - Japanese keyboard key names fail to parse\n- **Pain Point Addressed**: \"Want to remap language-switching keys\" - IME keys (無変換, 変換, 英数) cannot be used with Japanese names\n- **Goal Enabled**: \"Seamless multilingual input\" - Allows configuration files in user's native language\n\nAdditionally supports **Product Goals > Short-Term (Q1 2025)**:\n- **Linux Feature Parity**: Achieves parity with Windows version which handles UTF-8 correctly (Windows uses wide character APIs)\n- **Documentation**: Enables Japanese documentation with native examples\n\nEnables **User Outcome > For International Users**:\n- **Before**: \"I must manually edit 169 key definitions to English, breaking Japanese layout support\"\n- **After**: \"My Japanese .mayu files work perfectly, I can use native key names\"\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Correct UTF-8 Character Tokenization\n\n**User Story:** As an international keyboard user, I want the parser to correctly tokenize multi-byte UTF-8 characters in configuration files, so that I can use key names in my native language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc.).\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the tokenizer encounters a UTF-8 lead byte (0xC0-0xFF) THEN the parser SHALL correctly identify the character length (2, 3, or 4 bytes based on lead byte value)\n2. WHEN the tokenizer processes a multi-byte UTF-8 character THEN the parser SHALL skip the correct number of continuation bytes (0x80-0xBF) to maintain proper character boundaries\n3. WHEN a key is defined as `def key 無変換 NonConvert = 0x7b` THEN the parser SHALL tokenize \"無変換\" as a single complete token (6 bytes: E7 84 A1 E5 A4 89 E6 8F 9B)\n4. WHEN the tokenizer encounters a UTF-8 continuation byte (0x80-0xBF) outside of a multi-byte sequence THEN the parser SHALL treat it as an error and report invalid UTF-8 encoding\n5. WHEN parsing a configuration file with mixed ASCII and UTF-8 characters THEN the parser SHALL correctly tokenize both ASCII (single-byte) and UTF-8 (multi-byte) tokens without corruption\n\n### Requirement 2: Proper UTF-8 Key Name Registration and Lookup\n\n**User Story:** As a user with Japanese keyboard configuration files, I want key definitions with Japanese primary names to register correctly, so that both Japanese and English key name aliases work for remapping.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a key is defined as `def key 無変換 NonConvert = 0x7b` THEN the Key object SHALL store both \"無変換\" and \"NonConvert\" as valid names\n2. WHEN looking up a key by name \"NonConvert\" THEN the parser SHALL find the key defined with Japanese primary name \"無変換 NonConvert\"\n3. WHEN looking up a key by name \"無変換\" THEN the parser SHALL find the key using UTF-8-aware string comparison\n4. WHEN comparing UTF-8 key names THEN the system SHALL use the existing `strcasecmp_utf8()` utility for case-insensitive comparison (already used in Token class)\n5. IF a key name contains invalid UTF-8 byte sequences THEN the parser SHALL report a clear error message indicating the line number and corrupted character\n\n### Requirement 3: Backward Compatibility with Existing ASCII Configurations\n\n**User Story:** As an existing YAMY user with ASCII-only configuration files, I want the UTF-8 parser fix to maintain full backward compatibility, so that my existing `.mayu` files continue to work without modification.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN parsing an ASCII-only configuration file (all characters 0x00-0x7F) THEN the parser SHALL produce identical results as before the UTF-8 fix\n2. WHEN a key is defined with only ASCII names (e.g., `def key Esc Escape = 0x01`) THEN the key SHALL register and lookup exactly as it did before\n3. WHEN the tokenizer encounters single-byte ASCII characters THEN the parser SHALL process them with no performance degradation compared to the current implementation\n4. WHEN parsing large ASCII configuration files (>10KB) THEN the parsing time SHALL not increase by more than 5%\n\n### Requirement 4: UTF-8 Validation and Error Reporting\n\n**User Story:** As a configuration file author, I want clear error messages when my file contains invalid UTF-8 sequences, so that I can quickly identify and fix encoding issues.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the parser encounters an invalid UTF-8 lead byte (0x80-0xBF as first byte, or 0xF8-0xFF) THEN the parser SHALL report error: \"Invalid UTF-8 encoding at line X: invalid lead byte 0xYY\"\n2. WHEN a multi-byte sequence is incomplete (e.g., 2-byte character with only 1 byte before whitespace) THEN the parser SHALL report error: \"Invalid UTF-8 encoding at line X: incomplete multi-byte sequence\"\n3. WHEN a continuation byte is expected but a non-continuation byte (0x00-0x7F or 0xC0-0xFF) appears THEN the parser SHALL report error: \"Invalid UTF-8 encoding at line X: expected continuation byte, got 0xYY\"\n4. WHEN reporting UTF-8 errors THEN the parser SHALL include the line number, column number (if available), and the hexadecimal value of the problematic byte\n\n### Requirement 5: Cross-Platform UTF-8 Consistency\n\n**User Story:** As a cross-platform user, I want the same `.mayu` configuration file with Japanese key names to work identically on both Windows and Linux, so that I can share configurations across platforms.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a configuration file is saved with UTF-8 encoding (with or without BOM) on Windows THEN the Linux parser SHALL correctly process it\n2. WHEN a configuration file is saved with UTF-8 encoding (no BOM) on Linux THEN the Windows parser SHALL correctly process it\n3. WHEN a key name contains Japanese characters THEN the key SHALL be accessible by the same name on both Windows and Linux using UTF-8-aware comparison\n4. IF a configuration file contains a UTF-8 BOM (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF) THEN the parser SHALL automatically skip it and parse the file correctly (this is already implemented)\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The tokenizer fix shall be contained in `parser.cpp` with a dedicated `utf8_char_length()` helper function for UTF-8 byte sequence length calculation\n- **Modular Design**: UTF-8 utilities shall use the existing `stringtool.h` infrastructure (which already has `strcasecmp_utf8()`)\n- **Dependency Management**: The fix shall not introduce new third-party dependencies - use standard C++17 and existing utilities only\n- **Clear Interfaces**: The `Token` class interface shall remain unchanged; only internal tokenization logic is modified\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Input Latency**: UTF-8 character processing SHALL NOT add measurable latency to configuration file parsing (target: <5ms for typical 10KB `.mayu` file)\n- **Memory Overhead**: Token storage SHALL NOT increase memory usage beyond the actual UTF-8 character bytes (no wide character conversion or duplication)\n- **Parsing Speed**: Tokenization of UTF-8 characters SHALL be implemented with simple byte checks (no regex, no complex state machines)\n\n### Security\n\n- **Input Validation**: The parser SHALL validate all UTF-8 byte sequences against the UTF-8 specification (RFC 3629) to prevent buffer overruns from malformed sequences\n- **Bounds Checking**: When advancing pointers for multi-byte sequences, the parser SHALL verify `t + N` does not exceed buffer bounds before dereferencing\n- **Denial of Service**: The parser SHALL reject files with excessive invalid UTF-8 sequences (>100 errors) to prevent error message flooding\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Graceful Degradation**: If a single key definition contains invalid UTF-8, the parser SHALL skip only that definition and continue parsing the rest of the file\n- **Error Recovery**: After encountering an invalid UTF-8 sequence, the parser SHALL resynchronize at the next whitespace or newline character\n- **Test Coverage**: UTF-8 tokenization logic SHALL have unit tests covering all valid UTF-8 character ranges (1-byte, 2-byte, 3-byte, 4-byte) and common error cases (incomplete sequences, invalid lead bytes, unexpected continuation bytes)\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Transparent Operation**: Users SHALL NOT need to modify existing configuration files or change any settings to benefit from UTF-8 support\n- **Clear Documentation**: The parser error messages for UTF-8 issues SHALL be understandable to non-technical users (no hexadecimal dumps without explanation)\n- **Logging**: UTF-8 parsing errors SHALL be written to the engine log (`/tmp/yamy-engine.log` on Linux) with sufficient context for debugging\n",
