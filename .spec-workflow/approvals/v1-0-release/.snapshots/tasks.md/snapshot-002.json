Update tasks.md: Change `[ ]` to `[-]` (in-progress)\n2. Read the _Prompt field for detailed guidance\n3. Implement according to task description\n4. Test implementation thoroughly\n5. **CRITICAL: Log implementation** using log-implementation tool with:\n   - Clear summary of what was implemented\n   - Files modified/created with line counts\n   - **Required artifacts** (APIs, components, functions, classes, integrations)\n6. Update tasks.md: Change `[-]` to `[x]` (completed)\n\n### Success Metrics\n- All 17 tasks completed and marked [x]\n- Zero P0 bugs in issue tracker\n- Performance: <1ms latency (p99), <10MB RAM, <1% CPU idle\n- Coverage: ≥80% line coverage\n- Compatibility: Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch all passing\n- Release artifacts generated and uploaded\n\n---\n\n**Document Version**: 1.0\n**Last Updated**: 2025-12-12\n**Spec Name**: v1-0-release\n**Total Tasks**: 17 (across 6 tracks)\n**Estimated Effort**: 60-80 hours (1-2 weeks with dedicated focus)\n**Reviewed By**: (Pending approval)\n",
